                    I have been a software developer for close to 7 years now and 
                    I am branching into web development to round 
                    out my skills in the work place. I have worked at Hub Group Dedicated, formally Estenson Logistics,
                    for 5 years where i have increased my database skills in MySQL, SQL, and DB2
                    as well and my project management skills using tools like Jira and Confluance.
                    I am a believer that in a company you need to ask yourself "What can technology do
                    to make my job faster?".  No matter how small the task seems if you repeat it 
                    you are wasting time.

                    I got into development after years of wanting to be a Civil Engineer.  I was asked the questions "Why are you into building things? What drivers you? "  and my answer was simple, "Because i like to create things with my own hands.  Too put in the effort to find a problem and solve it.  From there i was shown what coding can do and how it can change more then just what you see but how you think. (I don't think i have used basic math in years with out a calculator.)
