            I have been a software developer for close to 7 years now and I am branching into web development to round out my skills
            in the work place. I have worked at Hub Group Dedicated, formally Estenson Logistics, for 5 years where i have
            increased my database skills in MySQL, SQL, and DB2 as well and my project management skills using tools like
            Jira and Confluance. I am a believer that in a company you need to ask yourself "What can technology do to make
            my job faster?". No matter how small the task seems if you repeat it you are wasting time.

            I got into development after years of wanting to be a Civil Engineer. I was asked the questions "Why are you into building
            things? What drivers you? " and my answer was simple, "Because i like to create things with my own hands. Too
            put in the effort to find a problem and solve it. From there i was shown what coding can do and how it can change
            more then just what you see but how you think. (I don't think i have used basic math in years with out a calculator.)
